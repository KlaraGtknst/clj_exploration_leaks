## conexp-clj

When running certain methods of conexp-clj I ran into compatibility problems:
While the highest supported Java version is 21, the library require a Java 23/ openjdk-23-jdk.
It is possible to overcome this issue by rather using a standalone jar 
than the default web repository from maven/ clojars.
In order to install the standalone jar with java 21 use the following command:
```shell
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/home/kgutekunst/IdeaProjects/conexp-clj/builds/uberjar/conexp-clj-2.6.0-standalone.jar -DgroupId=conexp-clj -DartifactId=conexp-clj -Dversion=2.6.0+java21 -Dpackaging=jar
```
